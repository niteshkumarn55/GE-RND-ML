Once a user is forced to scroll to see more items they lose context and the benefits of visual search are lost. Traditional search and list view presentation means users who do not immediately see an item that interests them may result in a lost sale.   Visual Search is how we find things in everyday life. In the supermarket we explore the aisles scanning shelves looking for the brands we recognise. In a fashion store we browse items that suit our style knowing what we like 'when we see it'. In a crowded room of people we look for the faces, shapes and features of people we know.

Sales cycles are longer and more individuals are involved in buying decisions, each with their own roles and priorities. They‰Ûªve also entered a new era where buyers are discovering and learning about companies through multiple online touchpoints, making content the centerpiece of their buying journey.  These changes require that successful B2B marketers be buyer-centric. To rise above the noise and drive engagement and consensus among the multiple people (personas) in an account, marketers must provide high quality content, messaging, and interactions that support buyers‰Ûª needs and processes in the manner they desire. Achieving this, however, is dependent on having a truly deep understanding of your buyers.  The challenge marketers face is that existing technologies do not fully support this shift from being vendor-centric to buyer-centric because they‰Ûªre solely focused on execution. While content production, account-based marketing, and personalization solutions exist, none of them can be used to their potential without first having Marketing-Sales alignment on the audience, how they buy, and how to effectively sell to them.

Comenta TV tools give social producers access to a mass volume of data, enabling them to find relevant tweets in real time to analyze the behavior and integrate the social audience on air with one click.  TV drives viewers to express emotions through comments on the social web. According to Nielsen 60% of TV viewers use social networks while watching TV and 30% comment about the shows they are watching. But it‰Ûªs difficult for TV stakeholders to keep track of real time interactions that surround TV shows and brands. Viewers are sharing comments in Twitter in several different ways (using mentions, diverse hashtags or natural language), making it challenging to follow the conversation beyond Twitter hashtags. Most of the information is lost.  The technology behind Comenta.TV was developed to solve this problem.By identifying viewers interactions we can offer real time metrics and analytics for networks, producers and advertisers, to help them better understand their audience (who, where, when, what, how engaged, from which source and how willing to share a show with their friends), increase engagement with custom visualizations and open new monetization‰Ûªs opportunities.  Comenta TV is giving TV networks and live events producers new tools to expand their business and give advertisers new windows to reach their BEST audience: - Algorithm to index every comment being made in social networks about a live TV show - First screen or on air integrations to engage the audience and increase the social reach of the show. - Real time analytics tools for TV shows and advertisers to better know their audience, and how influencers interact LIVE with their content and brands - Social TV brand affinity analysis to help brands in media buying decisions  TV networks, advertisers and production companies are paying between u$500 one shot fees, up to u$5.000 subscription fees a month for Comenta.

Giving the companies the edge they are looking for to grow faster.   In order to survive and succeed in this world of accelerating change, modern marketing professionals need a new generation of marketing software to help them find more future customers; to build, sustain and grow relationships with those buyers over time; and to cope with the sheer pace and complexity of engaging with customers in real-time across the web. And in many companies, marketing must knit these digital interactions together with the efforts of their colleagues on the sales team.   Marketers need to interact seamlessly with their customers across all stages of the sales funnel, and they need data and analytic insights to understand where and how to allocate their budgets for maximum return.  Our software must be easy to adopt and use. Visitors Lifecycle Management(VLM) software is fundamentally different from other kinds of business applications, like CRM, ERP and independent single point solution vendors. With those systems, the large companies typically configure them once, and then use them for months or even years with relatively little change. Marketing is much more dynamic ‰ÛÒ users need to constantly conceive, build and launch new marketing campaigns every few days or weeks, with minimum effort and no IT support. Our customers at Deskgod typically tell us that they spend one-half to one-third of the time as they did previously, which translates into much more time for them to invest in the creative aspects of their job.  Our software must be powerful enough to solve real-world challenges. Modern marketing is challenging, to say the least. Marketers must control all aspects of visitors lifecycle management without of consistently switching between multiple applications like email marketing, analytics, help desk, live chat and more. Visitors are the lifeblood of the online businesses. Visitors must accurately guided to become customers, before being snatched up by competitors . And today‰Ûªs marketer needs to be able to prove the results of their marketing investments, so sophisticated-yet-easy reporting and analytic tools are as important as campaign tools.   Deskgod was designed and built by real world marketing professionals who understand what marketers need to be successful. Still, Deskgod always balances powerful with easy, so that you can unleash the power when you need it, without having it in the way when you just need to get something simple done and out the door.

Co-founded in 2010 by Thomas Larkin and Benjamin Stewart, the Company is focused on harnessing the social media power of companies‰Ûª best advertisers ‰ÛÒ their customers.  Our guiding axiom is that word of mouth is the most trusted and effective form of all advertising. We believe that actual customers are the best marketers and, therefore, companies should hire them.  Retailers recognize this fact, however, the significant pain in the market has been how to effectively harness the power of word of mouth, track its ROI, and create a repeatable engagement structure.    ShareMagnet‰Ûªs application Social Rebate incentivizes customers to share products and brands on social networks after a purchase is made. This allows for effective tracking of word of mouth efforts and clearly shows the ROI.  Through a simple back-end integration, requiring no up-front fees and limited time commitment for most Ecommerce sites, customers are given the opportunity to rebate their purchase by sharing and promoting what they just bought with their online friends.  The application is fully integrated into all major social networks, including, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, and allows customers to login and post to their preferred social media site.  Each click of the link made by friends and family in the network rebates a portion of the original purchase back to the original customer.  The technology has a butterfly effect; secondary and tertiary purchasers can post a rebate link, too, which allows the client retailer to promote to a larger network and rebate additional customers.  To date, SocialRebate has impressively shown over a 15% conversion rate for rebates posted to social media sites for participating brands.  This revenue is incremental to existing marketing and customer acquisition efforts, and only costs a client (defined as a retailer who has integrated SocialRebate onto its ecommerce platform) when a purchase has been made.  SocialRebate is currently installed with 100 clients, has processed over 20,000 transactions, has a 15% participation rate on referrals, and has currently developed software to integrate with the top ecommerce software platforms.  The retention rate for integrated clients is over 90% and on the customer side each new rebate claimed is a new registered user waiting to be re-targeted to or syndicated. Additionally, an estimated 20% of revenue generated has been from pre-purchases of Share Magnets, including brands such as MySpace, Care.com, National Positions, Okabashi and Gazelle.com.",Enterprise Apps,Marketing,Content Marketing,Content Distribution,Social Media,Marketing-Content Marketing-Content Distribution-Social Media

It measures your photo-sharing activities across different photo-sharing networks (Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Instragram and Picplz) measuring your reach, quality and activity. It aims to help people find out their ability and influence as social photographers and to help them discover good photographers to follow.  The score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest possible score and it is based on your photo activity on specified social networking and photo-sharing sites. The Photorank system gives special emphasis to your activity in the last 21 days, and that is what your score will mostly reflect.  Photorank calculates your score based on three parameters:  Reach: How many different people are you influencing with your photos? The fact that you have a lot of friends on Facebook or followers on Twitter doesnÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢t mean that they care about your pictures. Are they interacting with them? Getting likes, loves, comments or retweets from a lot of different people shows that your pics are effectively influencing a wide audience and this is what is calculated into your Ì¢‰âÂèÏReachÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢. Activity: The more photos you take and post, the higher you activity is. However, be aware that if you just upload low quality content, it is likely that your overall score will go down. Quality: Deciding whether a photo is Ì¢‰âÂèÏgoodÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢ or Ì¢‰âÂèÏbadÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢ is a very challenging task. Therefore, we have decided to let others do the hard work while we analyze their interactions with your photos. Do people Ì¢‰âÂèÏlikeÌ¢‰âÂ‰ã¢ your photos? Do they get liked/retweeted/linked/shared, etc.?
