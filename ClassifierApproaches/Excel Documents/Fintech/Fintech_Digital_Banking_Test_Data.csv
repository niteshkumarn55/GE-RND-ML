Zero was built on the belief that people shouldn’t be required to take on debt just to get cash back on their spending.  Zero is powered by a mobile app and Zerocard, a solid metal card that comes in four levels, varying by rewards percentage and minimum annual spend to qualify.  The highest level card, Zerocard Carbon, gives customers 3% cash back on all purchases.  Zero is waiving the minimum spend requirements for a limited time for people who sign up for early access at zerofinancial.com and successfully invite friends to also sign up.  Zerocard acts like a debit card, where deposits and withdrawals appear in one place in the app with a real-time, net balance.  Unlike debit cards, however, it processes on credit card networks, thus allowing users to earn a flat cash back rate on all spending regardless of category.

ChimpChange is a mobile banking service available only in the US. ChimpChange bank accounts provide customers with a more useful bank account than a traditional account provided by incumbent banks, without all the fees.  The first benefit of ChimpChange is you can create an account within minutes, without visiting a branch. We conduct full electronic KYC (Know Your Customer) checks as required by the US Patriot Act. After a customer passes through full KYC, we open an account. The account is a bank account in their own name, with an Account Number and Routing Number, a debit MasterCard and their money is insured by the FDIC.  You can direct deposit your pay into the account, link one of your other bank accounts to it (like your Chase or Citi account), deposit a check, or load cash into the account at any 7Eleven, Walmart, CVS, Kmart, Walgreens or RiteAid.  ChimpChange has a number of useful FinTech tools such as predictive spending technology, and graphical display of transaction history. Each purchase on the MasterCard is auto-categorized into one of 24 spending categories. Transaction history is then displayed graphically, so at a glance customers can see exactly where their money is going, and how spending is tracking in each category compared to previous months.  ChimpChange also has a round-up savings account, making saving easier by rounding-up the spare change on each purchase.   ChimpChange MasterCards can be used around the world, including at any ATM. Customers can withdraw money out of ATMs for free at any MoneyPass ATM in the US.

In 2007, that vision was realized when OneCalifornia Bank and OneCalifornia Foundation opened in Oakland. Fashioned in the image of the great socially responsible banks and credit unions of national and international fame, the Bank is mandated to produce meaningful social justice and environmental benefits at the same time that it is financially sustainable. The Foundation owns all of the economic rights of the Bank -- when profits of the Bank are distributed, they can only be distributed to the Foundation which is mandated to reinvest those proceeds back into the communities and the environment on which they all depend. In their theory and experience, this ownership model aligns their incentives with the triple bottom line and the values of their bank customers.  In December 2010, OneCalifornia bank acquired ShoreBank Pacific and changed its name to One PacificCoast Bank. The merger greatly expanded the Bank's reach on the West Coast, and enhanced its capacity to serve its mission.

Shryk provides the iThryv next generation online banking platform to financial services organizations, and the integrated weProsper.org community to promote financial literacy.  Shryk provides a next generation online banking platform that creates an immersive environment for users.  Shryk has developed the first three flavors, and these are directed at Youth (5 to 11 years old) Teen (12 to 17 years old) and Young Adults (18 to 24 years old.)  The system allows users to manage their own bank accounts and be trained in financial literacy at the same time. The Shryk system may be the silver bullet that has been missing in the battle against the issues the US is having with financial literacy. At the same time, we provide a business solution to the banking and credit union industries to start the customer for life paradigm with young kids in a way that provides a whole new set of products for the financial industry.  The second half of this model is that Shryk provides access to the platform to schools and teachers for free, through the weProsper.org community site.  This allows a city to start kids in kindergarten with a simulated banking platform that looks exactly like what they will be able to use at a bank with real money when they choose. Not only does this enable schools to teach financial literacy on a sophisticated online delivery system for free, it also provides the onramp to drive new customers to our banking customers. The combination of both sides of this model is being hailed by many people in the financial literacy world as a possible breakthrough use of technology.  Shryk is enabling win-win public/private partnerships between financial institutions, schools, and parents in a way that is financially feasible for all.  While providing an environment for young people to manage their own finances in a way they simply cannot do at this time.  Shryk solves the following specific problems: 1. A solution for teaching financial literacy at the point of transaction that is robust and unique.  This is critical because of statistics such as the fact that approx. 25% of the personal bankruptcies in the US are filed by people 25 years old or less. 2. A service that helps banks and credit unions make more money through saving them costs on servicing small kids account on paper, making stickier relationships with parents, and providing an avenue for additional fee revenue 3. A free tool for schools to teach financial literacy.  Many are being mandated to do this by their state government, yet are getting no funds to implement it.

Dave decided that if the Banks weren’t willing to help ordinary people, then he would! Under the slogan “Bank on Dave!” and using the correct legal channels, Dave obtained the necessary documentation required to issue loans, and, feeling that High Street Banks treat people as credit scores and not individuals, decided to return to basics. As such, Burnley Savings and Loans Ltd DO NOT use a generic credit score, choosing a more personal approach to underwriting and dealing with all customers on a case by case basis. Once everything was in place to enable Burnley Savings and Loans Ltd to provide loans, Dave turned his attention towards savings. The first thing he noticed was just how little people were being offered on their savings. He decided that Burnley Savings and Loans Ltd should offer a highly competitive rate of interest, making customer’s savings work harder for them. And so, with the assistance of a great team of lawyers, Burnley Savings and Loans Ltd found a way of offering 5% AER in the form of a certificate for lenders and borrowers.

The complete lack of knowledge base in the Russian Federation banking compliance and capital adequacy system has traditional consulting firms caught off-guard and has provided the company with a significant advantage in integrating the ICAAP Constructor in the Federations’ banking system. The founder and CEO, Mr. Zeyn Adam who invented & designed the ICAAP Constructor software, has significant strategic experience and an extensive senior banking executive & director network, having implemented Basel rules in the EU, Africa and in Russia. Furthermore, he founded and chaired the Risk Management and Basel Standards Committee in the Russian Federation.  This committee is directly associated with the Central Bank of Russia’s initiative to bring the industry in-line with the rest of the global financial services industry. The Committee’s key remit is to review draft risk management regulation and to transform those regulations into practical laws for implementation by Russian Banks. The Central Bank of Russia relies on this Committee to develop and disseminate it proposed rules for the industry. Zeyn has also led the management and execution of a Basel implementation project at one of the largest and most progressive private Banks in Russia - Alfa Bank. The project is considered by the Central Bank of Russia to be the flagship project within the industry.
