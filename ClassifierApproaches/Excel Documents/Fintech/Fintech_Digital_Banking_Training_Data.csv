To that end, NetLaw offers a CRM for financial service agents that lets them promote and sell NetLaw to their clients and to receive commissions and new leads generated through the estate planning process.

The key to personalization lies in understanding why the person is connected to the brand so that the brand can optimally engage and activate that customer.  Discourse Analytics engages with our client’s customers across multiple channels and platforms to model every person in a customer-base to determine “why” he or she connects to the brand and “how” to drive activation.   We provide this model back to the brand as a data-append for integration into CRM systems to enable more human, scalable and contextually relevant two-way conversations with customers.   The profiles are formed using the Consumer Activation Platform:tm: (CAP) which has three differentiating attributes:  1) it determines “why” a customer connects with a brand; 2) it builds weighted attitudinal stacked-graph profiles with a remarkably small data set; and 3) it can utilize existing data to predictively and prescriptively model consumer behavior.   Rather than chasing “big data” the Company focuses on discrete data elements to map and build individual profiles and clusters. These outputs indicate the individual’s “key drivers” that construct the causal factors of that consumer’s decision cycle.  By honing in on the actual decision inducing factors, we drive improved ROI by increasing the accuracy and customer understanding beyond antiquated methodologies and proxies such as demography, focus groups and sample size-based surveys.   Whether enhancing engagement or activation, the lynchpin for the CAP’s insights stems from its ability to humanize data and unlock the untapped value in stakeholder relationships.

Designed and built by veterans of the industry, MCAtrack is a multi-tiered platform that can be accessed and operated from any computer without having to download any software or maintain any servers.  Utilizing a multi-tiered model, the platform allows for access by Funders, Syndicators, ISOs, Reps, and Merchants while compartmentalizing each deal so that information is limited to those specific users. Unlike the majority of systems out there, you can create an unlimited number of users at no additional cost.  The platform was designed using a Flat UI design concept which focuses on offering as much information in a simple and concise format, rather than creating visual clutter that will overwhelm the user; the focus is on content and functionality in a presentation format (think GoogleNow or iOS7).  But don’t let the simple user interface fool you, it’s a sophisticated system that can actively track merchant payments, batches, splits, and ACH debits/credits in real time.  Now, once you see the demo, you’ll like it and the wheels will begin to turn and you’ll fantasize about creating your own multi-faceted platform, but unfortunately this is a prevalent pattern within the industry, where companies get amped at the thought of a do-it-yourself project and consider the possibility of building their own system or at the very least buying some out of the box solution hoping that they can customize it to fit their needs.  Speaking from experience, we know it doesn’t work. Ever.  And it’s just the kind of money-pit that will set your business back 50k before you realize you should have stuck with a full service solution that was built from the ground up.  With in-depth reporting, the system offers the user the ability to utilize specific portfolio information that wouldn’t otherwise be available, including: Merchant Payment Reports, Syndicator Earnings reports, as well as the ability to email Commission Statements and Funding Statements through the platform’s backend. Those are the perks of using a full service solution.  But the most important thing the system offers its users is time; by eliminating the need for multiple excel sheets, manual data entry, and complex formulas, the system frees you up so you can spend more time pursuing leads and closing deals.

Founded in March of 2013, Public Funds Investment & Reporting (PFITR, ) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology company that enables those responsible for overseeing tax dollars to see valuation metrics based on market transactions to make the best investment decisions possible.   Treasurers, Directors of Finance, public CFOs—all are examples of public fiduciaries who oversee, cumulatively, trillions of dollars in their operational accounts.   State statutes and internal investment policies govern  the three mandates of  safety, liquidity, and yield.   Keeping the investments safe involves identifying, measuring and mitigating risk.    Liquidity is the second mandate and most entities keep an excess amount of cash and cash equivalents and because they lack the cash flow analytics required.   Buying too high, hidden commissions, and holding too much cash often sacrifice yield.   Our BPV™ tool provides them the analytics and internal controls to guide public fiduciaries to lessen  risk, commissions, and poor timing.   How do public fiduciaries, so burdened with conflicting demands and looming risks, respond? They either avoid doing anything or they take the advice of the bank or broker making the recommendation.   Many public fiduciaries lack the experience, technology and training to make optimal investment purchases, so they are dependent on the recommendations of the broker because most do not use  an advisor.   There is an inherent conflict of interest in many recommendations because, generally speaking, brokerages receive higher commissions when the product sold  is riskier  generally .  Most public fiduciaries are under-diversified, over-liquid and earning too little on their multi-million dollar portfolios.   Cumulatively, public fiduciaries currently invest trillions of taxpayer dollars each year.  In their flagship product, the Bond Price Validation tool (BPV™), PFITR provides public fiduciaries the information that they need to make optimal investment purchases. With proprietary, licensed data from strategic partners, including Moody’s, Interactive Data Corporation, CUSIP, and Standard & Poor’s, packaged into a user-friendly software interface, PFITR puts internal controls in place so that the public fiduciary  can make more informed decisions. . PFITR offers public fiduciaries market transparency for their investment purchases and inventories. Bond fees and commissions are not transparent and are rarely known.    The BPV™ tool is the most affordable and easy-to_use technology that lets public fiduciaries know market information about and pricing of investments before purchasing them`	.    In the world of public finance, proof is invaluable.  Constituents want proof that their public servants are doing a good job, and auditors demand it.  Bond Price Validation generates  instant reports for every transaction that a public fiduciary makes in comparison to comparable market transactions. With Bond Price Validation, constituents and auditors alike are able to view and understand exactly why public fiduciaries make the investments that they do.  PFITR has earned the attention of two early stage venture investors. Capital Innovators, the Missouri Technology Corporation and SixThirty are among a few of those who have cumulatively invested PFITR. In recent months, PFITR has built an impressive sales pipeline, with almost 100 product demos currently scheduled and a projected annual recurring revenue strea(ARR) of more than $300k by January 2016.  Together, these factors contribute to PFITR’s current valuation of $3.8MM.  Accordingly, PFITR seeks $380k for a 10% stake in the company.  With a total market size of 116,000 U.S. public entities, PFITR aims to convert 4,000 public entities to customers within five years.  This market penetration rate of about 3.5% requires PFITR to convert three customers in the month of September 2015 and post consistent, month-over-month sales growth of about 15% through 2017, at which time growth may slow to a more mature rate of 6%. Less than four months into their sales efforts and with only one full-time Sales Development Representative (SDR) and one Account Executive (AE), PFITR has already converted four new customers in September 2015.  At 4,000 customers, PFITR will achieve a valuation of more than $625MM."42764,piALGO Technologies,pi-algo.com,Financial Services,,Fintech,Digital Banking,Analytics,"Artificial Intelligence:Applications,Artificial Intelligence:Finance,Artificial Intelligence:Machine Learning,Fintech:Analytics,Fintech:Digital Banking","room booking,Peer to Peer lending,3D property tours",piALGO offers solutions to capital markets using adaptive algorithms with machine-learning technologies for analyzing big data.,"piALGO is bringing forward new technology for investing within the Capital Markets.

CreditPing.com went live in beta in December 2010. Its primary model is to generate lead fees by helping consumers find credit cards and offers that they are more likely to be approved for by collecting financial profiles from its registered users and using that information to match them with specific, targeted offers. This has resulted in higher conversion rates and greater lead quality than other card sites. CreditPing's registered users save time, effort, and credit score inquiries by using the CP matching model, while issuers reach the customers they want effectively and cheaply with the CreditPing platform. CreditPing will be able to extend this success to other related verticals, including pay day loans, debt consolidation, credit monitoring and identify theft protection, to name a few.  While spending just $15,000 on its initial marketing campaign (email, affiliate, strategic partnerships) from December 15 2010 through March 20, 2011, CreditPing has generated about 17,000 visits, resulting in 9,000 registered members (completed opt-ins AND 10 question demo profile), 3,400 of whom have actively reviewed offers, and over 800 clicking through to issuer's application page (with an average blended fee of $55). This first campaign has proven that consumers are willing to give CreditPing information about themselves in order to receive 'targeted' offers--which is the main premise and concept of CreditPing. With even basic optimization and tweaking of forms and creatives, response and conversion will dramatically improve.  CreditPing's senior launch team is in place, the website and back-end have been tested, and the traffic acquisition strategy is well defined and ready to scale. The company is preparing to do an 'A' round of approximately $3mm, which will fund traffic acquisition/marketing, team building, product development, and WC through 2013. By YE 2013 the Company expects about $10MM in EBITDA, roughly 800,000 active users, and a team of about 20 people.   In addition to the lucrative (and diversified) lead generation business, CreditPing will control a very valuable database of transaction-oriented consumers of all credit types who have proven to be reactive to financial offers. In addition, mobile credit decisioning, aggregated demand (social credit shopping) and branded products are all potential areas of lucrative growth for CreditPing that can be leveraged from the registered user base.

Loop Q—Loop AI Labs’ unsupervised cognitive computing platform—and the vertical Q Robots are critical engines of robotic process automation that will deliver large organizations across the tsunami of change brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  ABOUT US   Founded in 2012, Loop AI Labs’ scientific and engineering team has a long history of experience in researching and implementing artificial intelligence in organizations such as the Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI International (founded as Stanford Research Institute) and Stanford's Computational Semantics Lab, including participation in the $200M DARPA CALO project, the largest government-funded artificial intelligence project in history.   Loop AI Labs' flagship product is the Loop Q cognitive platform, a fully unsupervised next-generation machine intelligence technology, consisting of proprietary algorithms and low-cost, custom-built High Performance Computing GPU accelerated hardware. It automates processing and understanding of the dark data specific to each enterprise, breaking prevailing barriers that previously required tradeoffs among speed, cost, and quality.   Loop Q works on principles inspired by the neocortex, the brain’s center for language and reasoning. Loop AI’s homegrown algorithms learn the underlying structure and concepts within each organization’s dark data. Unlike competitors, our appliance does not require human guidance or labeling, domain-specific programming, or pre-defined dictionaries.
