Though there are other microlending websites that allow individuals to contribute funds toward microloans of their choice, all of them rely on local microfinance organizations to communicate with lenders, create loan applications and collect repayments. In these intermediated microlending platforms, the communication is all one way, so that the borrower is often unaware of the lenders who funded his or her loan. The average intermediary organization adds over 30% - sometimes as much as 100% - in fees and interest to loans raised through these websites to cover its own administrative expenses. Such high interest rates reduce borrowers' profits, sometimes to the point of making them poorer than they were before they received the loan.Unlike the postings on other microlending platforms, the loan applications and comments posted on Zidisha's loan pages are written by the borrowers themselves. This opens the way for dialogue between lenders and borrowers, so that lenders can receive answers to their inquiries about the loan and business directly from the entrepreneur they are funding. Eliminating unnecessary intermediaries also decreases cost of the loans. The average Zidisha borrower pays only about 8% (flat rate) in annual interest and fees, including interest paid out to lenders. This is far below the rates traditionally charged for microfinance loans in developing countries.  Reducing interest costs allows the entrepreneurs to keep more of their profits, so that the loans have greater impact in reducing poverty."Renrendai,renrendai.com,69490,FinTech,Alternative Lending ,Commercial Lending,Term loans,Term loans,Others,Alternative Lending -Commercial Lending-Term loans,"credit, finance, financial services","Renrendai is a Beijing-based company providing P2P financial services such as loans, debts, investment, and others.","Renrendai is a Beijing-based company providing a P2P platform for financial services such as loans, debts, investment, and others.

Most times, it's the largest line item on a company's balance sheet -- if not managed properly, a company is bound to struggle. Seeking short-term financing doesn't solve the inherent problem. It's expensive, renders control of customer relationships to a 3rd party, and forces companies into a viscous debt cycle. The truth is, there's a better, healthier, and more affordable way of accelerating cash flow. Managing AR the right way is the key. Current Accounting / ERP systems are not built for managing AR, and current software products out there are clunky, archaic, and painful to use. As a result, businesses resort to excel spreadsheets and pen & paper when managing AR. FundingGates' all-in-one AR Platform is different. It's been designed to provide a faster, smoother, and much more effective way of managing AR, giveing companies all the solutions they needs in one central place. The software automatically prioritizes all outstanding customer accounts, and creates a workflow with calls, emails, and payment options that yield the highest ROI -- from a time savings and order-to-cash perspective. Decisions on the platform are entirely data-driven, which allows for a bullet-proof AR process -- essential to climb up the ""payment priority list"" of a customer. FundingGates' AR Platform is optimized for success -- a team of AR Specialists will continuosly monitor our client's AR performance, and provide insightful and actionable recommendations.
